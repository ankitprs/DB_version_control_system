# Database Version Control system


 - i used mysql and express to build a data version control system.
 - where every interaction with DB is a transaction and saves to another table 
 - you can go back to any of the instance with transctionid, it is very effcent than 
 snapshot saving 
 - it is a simple project show caseing how can we use sql for a transction. where going back is needed some times.
